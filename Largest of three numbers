Here are 10 simple C programs to help you understand control structures (decision-making and loops) along with their solutions:

1. Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero (if-else)

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    if (num > 0)
        printf("The number is positive.\n");
    else if (num < 0)
        printf("The number is negative.\n");
    else
        printf("The number is zero.\n");

    return0
}
